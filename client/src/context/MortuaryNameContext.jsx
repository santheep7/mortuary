  // successful post-login fetch, it would overwrite the correct hospital's
  // name/logo with the fallback default. Each login page calls
  // fetchMortuarySettings() itself right after a successful login, so this
  // only needs to cover one case on its own: the user reloading the page
  // while already logged in (the login cookie is still valid, but no login
  // page runs to trigger the fetch). localStorage's role flag is a cheap,
  // synchronous signal for "was logged in" without needing to guess from
  // the (httpOnly, unreadable) cookie itself.
